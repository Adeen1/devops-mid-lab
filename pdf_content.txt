Question:                       [50 Marks] 
CLO: <5> Develop cloud native applications using current DevOps tools: Bloom Taxonomy Level: <Creating> 
 
Objectives: 
1. Design, containerize, and automate an open-source app with DB + cache/message queue. 
2. Provision infrastructure using Terraform on AWS. 
3. Deploy and manage the app using Kubernetes (EKS or Minikube). 
4. Automate configuration using Ansible. 
5. Implement CI/CD using Jenkins and/or GitHub Actions. 
6. Monitor the system with Grafana & Prometheus. 
7. Deliver a full production-ready DevOps stack. 
 
Step 1 – Project Selection and Containerization 
Extend the same project that was assigned to you for your midterm exam. The project must include database and 
cache/message queue. It should be extensible to microservices/Kubernetes. It must have the following: 
1. Dockerfile (optimized, multistage) 
2. Docker-compose.yml (for local testing). 
3. Container networking verified. 
4. Persistent storage for DB. 
5. No hardcoded secrets. 
 
Step 2 – Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform       [10 Marks] 
Goal: Automate AWS setup. Terraform must provision at least: 
• VPC + Subnets + Security Groups 
• EKS Cluster (Kubernetes) or EC2 instances (fallback option) 
• RDS/PostgreSQL or S3 bucket for persistence 
Deliverables:  
• infra/ folder with .tf files. 
• Outputs (terraform output) showing provisioned resources. 
• Screenshot of AWS Console with created resources. 
• terraform destroy proof (cleanup). 
 
Step 4 – Configuration Management (Ansible)        [05 Marks] 
Goal: Configure servers or containers automatically. You can use Ansible to: 
• Install dependencies on EC2s or Kubernetes nodes. 
• Deploy app configs or secrets. 
• Automate Docker or K8s deployment. 
Deliverables:  
• ansible/playbook.yaml 
• Inventory file (host.ini or dynamic AWS inventory). 
• Screenshot of successful playbook run. 
 
Step 5 – Kubernetes Deployment          [10 Marks] 
Goal: Deploy the containerized app to Kubernetes (EKS or local Minikube). Required Manifest include: 
• deployment.yaml 
• service.yaml 
• configmap.yaml or secret.yaml 
• (Optional) ingress.yaml or helm/ chart. 
Expected:  
• App pod communicates with DB (service) 
• Redis/Queue as sidecar or separate deployment 
• Namespace organization (dev, prod) 
• Screenshot: kubectl get pods, kubectl get svc, kubectl describe pod <name> 
 
Step 6 – CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins or GitHub Actions)       [10 Marks] 
Goal: Fully automated multi-stage pipeline. 
1. Build & test 
2. Security/ linting 
3. Docker build and push 
4. Terraform apply (infrastructure provisioning) 
5. Ansible deploy or kubectl apply 
6. Post-deploy smoke tests 
Deliverables:  
• Jenkinsfile or .github/workflows/main.yml 
• Pipeline screenshot with all stages passed. 
 
Step 7 – Monitoring & Observability (Grafana + Prometheus)     [10 Marks] 
Goal: Integrate monitoring for app and DB performance. 
Requirements: 
• Prometheus collects metrics (can be from app or node-exporter) 
• Grafana dashboard visualizes key metrics 
• Include screenshots of dashboards (CPU, memory, request count, etc.) 
 
Step 8 – Documentation and Report           [5 Marks] 
Each group must include two documents: 
1. README.md: 
• How to run locally, via Compose, and via K8s 
• Infra setup and teardown instructions 
2. devops_report.md: 
• Technologies used 
• Pipeline + infrastructure diagram 
• Secret management strategy 
• Monitoring strategy 
• Lessons learned
